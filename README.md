# msLDAPDump
LDAP enumeration tool implemented in Python3

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/M4M03Q2JN)

msLDAPDump simplifies LDAP enumeration in a domain environment by wrapping the lpap3 library from Python in an easy-to-use interface. Like most of my tools, this one works best on Windows. If using Unix, the tool will not resolve hostnames that are not accessible via eth0 currently.

### Binding Anonymously

Users can bind to LDAP anonymously through the tool and dump basic information about LDAP, including domain naming context, domain controller hostnames, and more.

### Credentialed Bind

Users can bind to LDAP utilizing valid user account credentials. Using credentials will obtain the same information as the anonymously binded request, as well as checking for the following:

* Users
* Groups
* Kerberoastable Accounts
* ASREPRoastable Accounts
* Constrained Delegation
* Unconstrained Delegation
* Computer Accounts - will also attempt DNS lookups on the hostname to identify IP addresses
* Identify Domain Controllers
* Identify MSSQL Servers
* Identify Exchange Servers
* Group Policy Objects (GPO)
* Passwords in User description fields

Each check outputs the raw contents to a text file, and an abbreviated, cleaner version of the results in the terminal environment. The results in the terminal are pulled from the individual text files.

### To-Do
- [ ] Add support for LDAPS (LDAP Secure)
- [ ] Figure out why Unix only allows one adapter to make a call out to the LDAP server (removed resolution from Linux until resolved)

### Mandatory Disclaimer
Please keep in mind that this tool is meant for ethical hacking and penetration testing purposes only. I do not condone any behavior that would include testing targets that you do not currently have permission to test against.
